# Shopping Cart Functionality Testing Scenarios

Add a Product to the Cart:

Verify that a product can be successfully added to the cart from the product listing page.
Ensure that the product is correctly reflected in the cart with accurate details, including the name, price, and quantity.
Confirm that the product image is displayed correctly in the cart.
Remove a Product from the Cart:

Test removing a product from the cart and verify that the product is no longer displayed.
Ensure that the total price in the cart updates correctly after the product is removed.
Update Product Quantity in the Cart:

Test updating the quantity of a product in the cart.
Ensure that the cart correctly updates the total price based on the new quantity.
Confirm that the quantity cannot be updated to a negative value or zero.
Add Multiple Units of the Same Product:

Test adding multiple units of the same product to the cart.
Ensure that the cart reflects the correct quantity and that the total price is updated accordingly.
Verify that the product is not duplicated in the cart; instead, the quantity should increase.
Cart Persistence (Not applicable if feature is absent):

Add a product to the cart, then refresh the page.
Ensure that the cart contents remain intact after the page is refreshed.
Initiate Checkout Process:

Verify that the checkout process can be initiated from the cart.
Confirm that the cart displays the correct totals and product information during checkout.
Check if the cart redirects correctly to the checkout page.
Post-Purchase Behavior:

After completing a purchase, verify that the cart is cleared automatically.
Ensure that the user is redirected to a confirmation page or another appropriate page.
Test whether the system allows a second purchase of the same items immediately after the first purchase.
Error Handling:

Test scenarios where the cart encounters errors, such as network failures or server issues.
Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed and that the cart remains functional.
Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Test the shopping cart functionality across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Ensure that all features work consistently across these browsers.
Pop-Up Handling:

Check if any pop-ups appear when interacting with the cart (e.g., adding or removing products).
Ensure that the pop-ups function correctly and do not interfere with the cart's functionality.
Preventing Negative or Zero Quantity:

Ensure that the cart does not allow users to set the quantity of a product to a negative value or zero.
Confirm that the quantity field is properly validated to avoid such scenarios.
